## Interfacing (Teensy USB Development Board)

### Description
Specific constraints, challenges, and attributes that are unique to embedded systems are coded. The role andcapabilities of such compact systems in today's world is analyzed, with detailed reference to available processingspeed, storage and power consumption. Students gain knowledge of sensors and actuators, their operationalparameters and characteristics. Methods for interfacing, sampling, and controlling the devices are studied, includingpolled vs. interrupt driven, D to A and A to D conversions and simple digital vs. PWM outputs.

Each folder contains one or more interfacing code for the Teensy microcontroller.

.fzz extension opens using the program Fritzing CAD software
.ino extension opens using Arduino IDE, and is required to load Teensy with instructions

The .png files are the .fzz images/schema incase Fritzing is not installed.
